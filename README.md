# ⚡ MeeChain MeeBot Protocol

MeeChain MeeBot is a high-performance, mystical dashboard designed for the MeeChain ecosystem. It enables verified collective members to monitor telemetry, participate in staking rituals, and visualize their mechanical asset galleries.

## 🔮 System Architecture

- **Core:** Viem + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain Interface:** Public RPC client with resilient fallback nodes.
- **State Management:** Zustand-inspired Context state for global account/balance/event tracking.
- **Reliability:** Defensive coding with mock data fallbacks and BigInt-safe serialization.

## 🚀 The Ritual of Initiation (Setup)

### 1. Clone & Prepare
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MEECHAIN1/meechain-meebot.git
cd meechain-meebot
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Energy Vectors (.env)
Create a `.env` file with the following coordinates:
```env
VITE_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9545
VITE_NFT_ADDRESS=0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
VITE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
VITE_STAKING_ADDRESS=0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0
```

### 3. Channel the Local Stream
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Verification Rituals (Testing)

### Unit Testing
Verify service integrity using mock providers:
- `token.test.ts`: Balance retrieval & transfer logic.
- `staking.test.ts`: Reward rate synthesis.

### Integration Testing
Ensure the UI responds correctly to contract events and wallet states using mock connectors.

## 🌐 Ascension (Deployment)

Deploying to Vercel or Netlify ensures the ritual is accessible globally:
1. Set the **Environment Variables** in your deployment dashboard.
2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build and smoke-test the protocol.
3. Verify the **BigInt** handling is consistent across the production build.

---

## 🤝 Contribution Rituals

1. **Naming:** Use lowercase keys (nft, token, staking) for consistency.
2. **Icons:** Use emoji-powered feedback (⚡ 💎 📥 🎉).
3. **Safety:** Always wrap contract reads in `try/catch` with mock fallbacks to prevent telemetry blackout.
